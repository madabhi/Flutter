## My First Flutter App
This is my first Flutter app, a simple project that displays text on the screen. It serves as a starting point for learning Flutter and understanding the basics of building a mobile app using the framework.

# Features
Displays a static text message on the screen.
Minimalistic user interface.
Easy-to-understand code structure.

# Folder Structure
The project follows a standard Flutter folder structure:

lib: Contains the main Dart code for the app.
main.dart: Entry point of the application.
screens: Contains the app screens.
home_screen.dart: The main screen of the app displaying the text message.
widgets: Contains reusable widgets used in the app.
text_display.dart: Widget to display the text on the screen.
test: Contains the unit tests for the app.
# Dependencies
The app does not rely on any external dependencies beyond the Flutter framework itself. However, please make sure you have the latest Flutter SDK installed.
